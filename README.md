# Impartial Games


This repository contains the C++ implementation of two impartial games: Nim and Chomp. Each of the games can be played with either an AI or another player. The games are implemented with the misère play rule.

### Getting Started

#### Instalation 

Clone this repository to your local machine using:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/annkarpe/Impartial-Games.git
```
#### Running tests
In order to run the tests on Linux machine you can use these commands:
1. Create a build directory inside a project directory
``` bash
mkdir build
```
2. Configure and generate build files inside 'build' directory
``` bash
cmake -S . -B build
```
3. Read the Makefile generated by CMake and build the project
``` bash
cd build && make
```
4. Run the executable file
``` bash
./imp
```
### Game rules

#### Nim
The game of Nim is represented by several heaps of tokens. Two players take turns removing tokens from the heaps. During one move it's possible to remove tokens only from at most heap. At least one token should be removed during the move. The player, who removes the last token loses (misère play).

#### Chomp
The game of chomp is represented by a rectangular grid of tokens (like a chocolate bar) and as well as in Nim game, two players thake turns removing tokens. On each turn a player must remove a rectangular block of tokens from the grid, at least one element. Unlike the Nim game, all the tokens to the right and above the choosen token are taken. Consequently, the player is allowed to remove tokens from more than one row. The player, who removes the last token loses (misère play).
